  about: |
    From my early school days I use to blog about Windows and Linux customization, from managing my own blog and trying to customize and tweak it every now and then. I became interested in Web development and I started learning it, from some basic html/css and little bit of JavaScript. Now, I am a passionate software developer with a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. 

    I love working with cutting-edge tech and I'm always trying to find new things to learn and grow. Currently, I work with the JavaScript stack. Angular / React / Svelte, Typescript, Nx, Storybook, Jest, Redux, Ngrx, Rxjs, Npm, Nodejs, Git. SCSS/CSS, HTML are my home.

    Some other tools I'm familiar with: Gitlab, Gitlab CI, Visual Studio Code, Capacitor, Appflow, Jira, Slack, Github, Figma.
